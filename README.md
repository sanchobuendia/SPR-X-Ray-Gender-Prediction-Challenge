# SPR-X-Ray-Gender-Prediction-Challenge

The Radiology and Diagnostic Imaging Society of São Paulo (SPR), with Amazon Web Services, is organizing the Artificial Intelligence Challenge to determine gender and age using chest X-rays for the first time. And all healthcare professionals and data scientists worldwide are invited to participate.

The challenge is to create a model capable of predicting the patient's gender and age group through chest X-rays. To ensure the success of this activity, SPR invited institutions to collaborate with the donation of tens of thousands of images; this data allows participants to create artificial intelligence algorithms to indicate the gender and age of the patient.

This action aims to encourage initiatives that present in advance potential identification errors that could harm the patient, in addition to promoting scientific and educational activities for the Radiology and Diagnostic Imaging community.

The first 50 participants who submit solutions to the leaderboard will earn $30 credits to use on any AWS service - the participant can only use this credit on their AWS account.

The top three winners of the competition will be acknowledged during Jornada Paulista de Radiologia (JPR) 2023. All participants are invited to register and participate in JPR.
